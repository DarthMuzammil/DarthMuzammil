# Hi, I'm Muzammil 👋

I'm a full-stack software engineer and AI enthusiast based in Bengaluru, with a focus on innovative projects in the AI LLM space. I enjoy building tools that simplify complex tasks and continuously improve developer workflows.

## 📦 Featured Project: llmcodxtractor

I built and published **llmcodxtractor** – a PyPI pip library designed to validate local LLM queries. This tool automatically re-prompts within the same session (using a predefined constant) until it receives an output in the correct format.  
[View llmcodxtractor on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/llmcodxtractor/)  
*(Download stats and additional details available on the PyPI page.)*
